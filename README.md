Group Members: Taylor Van Valkenburg, Kristen Celotto, Victor Hugo Mazariegos, and Mark Pipher

The dataset includes multiple strains of Marijuana, a user rating, user described effects, taste and desription. The description was seen as the key feature in the dataset and was chosen as the feature upon which to predict a product rating. The intent of this was to create a model which could be used by a business owner to intelligently stock their inventory with only the highest rated products.
